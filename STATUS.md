# STATUS.md — ExaltedFable project checkpoint

Purpose: the latest safe state of the project, for AI assistants and future me.
Keep this file short and factual. It is a checkpoint, not a changelog.

## Current Status
- Stable. All tests passing (23/23).
- Phase 1 (database foundation) and Phase 2 skeleton (provider abstraction) committed.
- Published to GitHub (public): https://github.com/crollila/exalted-fable-news-trader

## Latest Confirmed Commit
- `4de84e1` — docs(claude): add commit/push workflow with review-first default

## Current Phase
Phase 2 — News Provider Abstraction (skeleton done; real adapters not started).

## Completed Work
- Initial setup (repo, docs, .gitignore, .env.example).
- Phase 1: config module with paper/live safety parsing, SQLite layer,
  versioned migrations, initial 6-table schema, 11 validation tests.
- Phase 2 skeleton: provider contract (JSDoc + runtime validators),
  canonical news event normalization, mock provider, 12 provider tests.

## Current Architecture
- Node.js ESM, zero runtime dependencies (Node >= 22.5 required).
- SQLite via Node built-in `node:sqlite`; `src/database/db.js` is the only
  file touching the driver (swap point for better-sqlite3/Postgres later).
- Versioned SQL migrations in `src/database/migrations/`, runner is idempotent.
- Timestamps: UTC ISO-8601 text everywhere.
- Providers are pluggable; canonical event shape defined in
  `src/providers/newsProvider.js`, built by `src/providers/normalize.js`.
- Tests: Node built-in test runner (`npm test`).
- No real provider API calls, no sentiment/model calls, no execution/trading calls yet.

## Hard Safety Rules
- Do not overwrite or depend on the V1 repo.
- Paper trading only. Live trading disabled by default and unusable;
  enabling requires LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true AND
  CONFIRM_LIVE_TRADING_I_UNDERSTAND_RISK=true, and no code consumes it.
- Never commit API keys, secrets, .env, database files, or logs.
- Measurement before strategy optimization.
- Keep providers pluggable; no hard-coding around one source.

## Known Warnings / Technical Debt
- `node:sqlite` emits ExperimentalWarning on Node 22 (stable on Node 23.4+).
- `start` script points to src/index.js, which does not exist yet.
- newsType is always "other" until Phase 3 classification.
- Normalized events are not yet persisted (no insert/query helpers).

## Next Recommended Task
Database insert/query helpers for news events (persist normalized events
with dedup via provider + provider_event_id), then mock ingestion test.

## Maintenance Rule
After every approved commit, Claude should update STATUS.md with:
- latest commit hash and message
- current phase
- completed work
- current architecture notes
- known warnings or technical debt
- next recommended task
